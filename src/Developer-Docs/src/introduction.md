  <strong>IThreeM - I3M Developer Documentation</strong>
</h1>

Practical reference and user guides for [I3M Developer Docs](https://github.com/IThreeM/I3M-Developer-Docs) and its editor [I3M Engine Editor](https://github.com/IThreeM/I3M-Engine-Core/tree/main/editor).

> ⚠️ Tip: If you want to start using the engine as fast as possible - read this [chapter](./beginning/scripting.md).

**Warning:** The book is in early development stage, you can help to improve it by making a contribution in its
[repository](https://github.com/IThreeM/I3M-Developer-Docs).

## Engine Version

I3M Team is trying to keep the book up-to-date with the latest version from `main` branch. If something does not
compile with the latest release from crates.io, then you need to
[use the latest engine from GitHub repo](./beginning/scripting.md#using-the-latest-engine-version).

## How to read the book

Almost every chapter in this book can be read in any order, but we recommend reading Chapters 1, 2, 3 (they're quite small)
and then going through [Platformer Tutorial (2D)](./tutorials/platformer/part1.md) while learning more about specific
areas that interest you from the other chapters. There is also a [First-Person Shooter Tutorial (3D)](tutorials/fps/tutorial-1/fps-tutorial.md)
and [RPG Tutorial (3D)](./tutorials/rpg/intro.md).

## API Documentation

The book is primarily focused on game development with I3M, not on its API. You can find API docs
[here](https://docs.rs/i3m/latest/i3m/).

## Required knowledge

We're expecting that you know basics of Rust programming language, its package manager Cargo. It is also necessary
to know the _basics_ of the game development, linear algebra, principles of software development and patterns,
otherwise the book will probably be very hard for you.
